At the end of the event, the winning videos will be shared internationally, inspiring new actions and amplifying the reach of these attitudes.

She was a collaborating researcher at the Max Planck Institute, under a scientific cooperation agreement with the National Institute for Amazon Research (INPA), between 1991 and 1997, as well as a professor-advisor in the Postgraduate Program in Tropical Biology at INPA/UFAM and the Postgraduate Program in Environmental Sciences and Sustainability in the Amazon until 2006. Between 1997 and 2006, she was a professor at the Federal University of Amazonas (Institute of Biological Sciences), working in the area of Ecology, and coordinator of the Integrated Aquatic Resources and Floodplain Program – PYRÁ. She designed the Postgraduate Program in Environmental Sciences and Sustainability in the Amazon, which she coordinated between 1999 and 2003, before taking on the Technical-Scientific Directorate of the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation (FAPEAM), a position she held until June 2005, receiving an honorable mention for her performance in strengthening the state science and technology system. She coordinated the project 'Fisheries and Management of Large Migratory Catfish in the Amazon' (2003–2005), funded by UNDP/Provárzea-IBAMA, with the participation of three Brazilian federal institutions and the SINCHI Institute (Colombia). The project resulted in the development of an integrated and participatory management plan for these species in the Amazon Basin, with measures for neighboring countries, published as a book in 2005. Since 2006, she has been a professor at the Federal University of Alagoas, where she designed the Postgraduate Program in Biological Diversity and Conservation in the Tropics (ICBS/UFAL), where she is a permanent professor and served as coordinator for two terms. She conducts research in ecology and fisheries resource management since the beginning of her career, with scientific production including over 150 titles: 93 articles in national and international journals, 31 book chapters, and 7 organized books. She has supervised 27 master’s dissertations and 11 doctoral theses. Her technical-scientific career is associated with the conservation of natural resources, with an emphasis on fisheries and the socio-environmental development of communities using these resources. Since 2017, she has been part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program – PELD Costa dos Corais Alagoas (CNPq/FAPEAL), coordinating the second cycle (2020–2024), conducting research on estuarine fish ecology, assessment of tropical marine fisheries resources, and socio-environmental actions with traditional communities in the Costa dos Corais APA."
